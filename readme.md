# Dice Roll Simulation for task 07 

## Methods Used
- Monte Carlo method for simulating dice rolls.
- Statistical analysis of the obtained probabilities.
- Data visualization using a histogram.

## Results
- After executing a million simulations, the obtained probabilities are very close to the analytical values.
- The highest probability for two dice occurs at a sum of 7 (~16.67%).
- The distribution edges (sums of 2 and 12) have the lowest probabilities (~2.78%).
- The histogram confirms the accuracy of the calculations and the correctness of the algorithm.

## Conclusions
- Using a large number of simulations (1,000,000) allows us to approximate theoretical values.
- The distribution of obtained sums corresponds to analytical calculations, demonstrating the fairness of probabilities in random dice rolls.
- The histogram is an effective way to visualize the results.
